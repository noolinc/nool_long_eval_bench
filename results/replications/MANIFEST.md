# Replication manifest

Every run's own JSON carries its full provenance block; this manifest indexes
the experiment-level conditions for cross-run comparison.

| Condition | Run 1 | Run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Date (UTC) | 2026-08-20 (17:11–18:55) | 2026-08-20 (19:07–) |
| nool | 6.13.0 | **6.14.0** (upgraded between runs) |
| git | 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155) | 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155) |
| go | 1.26.2 darwin/arm64 | 1.26.2 darwin/arm64 |
| Claude Code CLI | 2.1.237 | 2.1.237 |
| Model (all LLM cells) | claude-sonnet-5 | claude-sonnet-5 |
| Python | 3.11.2 | 3.11.2 |
| Platform | macOS 26.5.2 arm64 | macOS 26.5.2 arm64 |
| Execution | local, adapter isolation `--setting-sources project,local` | same |

**Run 2 is a cross-version re-test, not a same-conditions replication** —
nool moved 6.13.0 → 6.14.0 between runs (caught by provenance stamping).

Data locations:
- Track B run 1: `run1_micro_2026-08-20/` (snapshot). Track B run 2:
  `../micro/` (current).
- Track C and D runs append to `../trackc/runs.jsonl` and
  `../trackc/fleet_runs.jsonl`; runs are distinguished by `started_utc`
  and per-record version fields.

**Cross-version replication of the four bounding findings (Track B):**
B5 semantic-layer-classifies-but-file-merge-conflicts: identical
(1 clean / 14 conflicts, sem-pass 15/15, all reps, both versions).
B7 bisect names first post-good knot instead of culprit: identical.
B3 pluck destroys later unrelated work (both timeline variants): identical.
B4 parseable test-breaking change accepted through propose + deferred
validation: identical.
